# ACTITIME-2017.4
The ACTi Time is a tool where the Test Manager provides task to the tester. The Test Manager can watch for how many hours a tester is working

I did a minor project during my training at QSpider. In this project I identified 50 scenarios, 10 minor bugs and 5 major bugs. The ACTi Time is a tool where the Test Manager provides task to the tester. The Test Manager can watch for how many hours a tester is working. My responsibility was to write test case on these scenarios. I also automated it using Selenium, TestNG, POM class, Frame work.
